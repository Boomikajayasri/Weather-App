This Weather App is a user-friendly, responsive application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to get real-time weather information for any location they enter. With a clean, intuitive interface, the app displays the current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Using the OpenWeatherMap API, the app dynamically fetches and updates weather data based on user input. The background of the app changes to match the current weather conditions, providing an immersive experience. Built with responsive design principles, this app looks and works great on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand the basics of API integration, responsive design, and JavaScript interactivity. Future plans include adding features like a multi-day forecast and location-based weather retrieval using the userâ€™s device location.
